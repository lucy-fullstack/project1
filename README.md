# My first project!
**Developer Project Estimation Tool**

This project is an intuitive tool designed for front-end, backend, and fullstack developers to estimate the time and cost of their freelance projects. 

The tool guides users step-by-step through a series of questions, helping them clarify project details, estimate the time required, and calculate the overall cost based on either a predefined hourly rate or a data-driven suggested rate based on location, experience, and other relevant factors. ðŸ¤“

**Features**


**Project Scope Clarification**: Users can define project scope and specific tasks (e.g., API integrations, component building, database design).

**Time Estimation:** Provides suggestions for time estimates based on task complexity.

**Hourly Rate Calculation:**

If the user already knows their rate, they can input it directly.

If they don't, the tool suggests an hourly rate based on location, years of experience, tech stack, and market data (updated to October 4, 2024).

**Project Cost Calculation:** The tool calculates the total cost based on time estimates and the hourly rate.

**Editable and Flexible:** Users can adjust time, rates, or scope at any stage.

**Optional Margin:** Add a 10-20% safety margin for unexpected complexities.

**Export:** Generate a PDF summary of the project scope, time, and cost estimates.

**Usage**

**Select Your Role:** Choose between front-end, backend, or fullstack development roles.
